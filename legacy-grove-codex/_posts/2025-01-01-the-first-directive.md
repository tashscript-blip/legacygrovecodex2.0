Chaos is not the enemy. Chaos is the fuel.

In the design of the **Legacy Grove Codex**, we do not build for stability alone. Stability is fragile; it breaks under stress. We build for *antifragility*—systems that get stronger when attacked.

When we separate the "Head" (the website) from the "Body" (the payment logic), we ensure that no single point of failure can destroy the Dynasty.

This is the philosophy of the 100-Year Plan. We do not write code for next week. We write code for the next century.
