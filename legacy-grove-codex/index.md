    <h3>The Directive</h3>
    <p>The digital landscape is shifting. Rent-seeking platforms are crumbling. The future belongs to those who own their infrastructure.</p>
    <p><strong>Legacy Grove Codex LLC</strong> is a research and design entity dedicated to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sovereignty:</strong> Owning the platform, not renting it.</li>
        <li><strong>Antifragility:</strong> Systems that gain strength from chaos.</li>
        <li><strong>Myth-Making:</strong> Narratives that span centuries.</li>

                We are entering the era of the <strong>Sovereign Architect</strong>. The old institutions are crumbling, and the digital rent-seekers are tightening their grip.
            </p>
            <p>
                I founded <strong>Legacy Grove Codex LLC</strong> with a singular directive: <strong>To engineer antifragile systems for generational wealth.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                From the <em>Six-Account Mercury Sweep</em> to the <em>Sentinel AI Architecture</em>, my work is not about "hustle." It is about <strong>Structure</strong>. It is about building a Citadel that can withstand the chaos of the next century.

                I do not teach you how to play the game. I teach you how to own the board.
